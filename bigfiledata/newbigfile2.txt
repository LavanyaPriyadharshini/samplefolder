        {
            // Check if the user has already been assigned a question
            var assignedQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl

            if (assignedQuestion != null)

        }



here even if the same user logs in again andgives the test, then also the questoins must be different ,the same question should not get repeated to the same user,they should get the next questions only
ChatGPT said:
To ensure that the same question doesn't get assigned to the same user, and instead, the next available question is assigned each time they log in and take the test, you can modify your logic slightly. Specifically, instead of simply checking if a question is already assigned to the user, you should also track which question the user has already been assigned in a way that ensures the next question is always unique to that user.

Updated Code:
[HttpGet("GetQuesDetByUser")]
public async Task<ActionResult<newCusSupQues>> GetQuestionForUser(string user)
{
    // Check if the user has already been assigned a question
    var assignedQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .Where(q => q.AssignedTo == user)
        .OrderByDescending(q => q.QuesNo)  // Get the most recent question assigned to the user
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

    // If the user already has an assigned question, determine the next available question
    if (assignedQuestion != null)
    {
        // Get the next question number
        var nextQuestionId = assignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1;

        // Fetch the next question based on its order
        var nextQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(q => q.QuesNo == nextQuestionId);

        // If there's a next question available, assign it to the user
        if (nextQuestion != null)
        {
            nextQuestion.AssignedTo = user;
            await _CusQuestContext.SaveChangesAsync();
            return Ok(nextQuestion);
        }
        else
        {
            return NotFound(new { error = "No more available questions for the user." });
        }
    }

    // If no question has been assigned yet, assign the first question
    var firstQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .OrderBy(q => q.QuesNo)  // Assuming the questions are ordered by QuesNo
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

    if (firstQuestion != null)
    {
        firstQuestion.AssignedTo = user;
        await _CusQuestContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        return Ok(firstQuestion);
    }
    else
    {
        return NotFound(new { error = "No available questions for assignment." });
    }
}
Explanation of Changes:
Check Assigned Questions: The query now checks the most recent question assigned to the user by ordering the questions by QuesNo in descending order. This helps us know the last question the user was assigned.

Next Question Assignment: After retrieving the last assigned question, the code determines the next question based on QuesNo + 1. This guarantees that the user gets the next question in sequence, and it prevents assigning the same question again.

Edge Case Handling: If the user hasn't been assigned any question yet, the first question (QuesNo = 1) will be assigned. If there are no available questions, a NotFound response is returned.

With this logic, when a user logs in again, they will receive the next available question in sequence, ensuring they don't get the same question twice.

here it is coming correctly for the assigned user, ensure that when a new user login ,then also the next order question only should be fethed
ChatGPT said:
To ensure that a new user gets the next available question in order when they log in (and not repeat questions assigned to others), you need to check for the next available question when no previous question has been assigned to the user, while ensuring the logic handles assigning questions in order for new users.

Here’s how you can adjust the code for both the cases:

If the user is not assigned any question yet, fetch the first available question.
If the user has been assigned a question already, fetch the next question in order based on QuesNo.
Updated Code:
[HttpGet("GetQuesDetByUser")]
public async Task<ActionResult<newCusSupQues>> GetQuestionForUser(string user)
{
    // Check if the user has already been assigned a question
    var assignedQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .Where(q => q.AssignedTo == user)
        .OrderByDescending(q => q.QuesNo)  // Get the most recent question assigned to the user
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

    // If the user has been assigned a question, assign the next available question
    if (assignedQuestion != null)
    {
        // Get the next question number
        var nextQuestionId = assignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1;

        // Fetch the next question based on its order
        var nextQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(q => q.QuesNo == nextQuestionId);

        // If there's a next question available, assign it to the user
        if (nextQuestion != null)
        {
            nextQuestion.AssignedTo = user;
            await _CusQuestContext.SaveChangesAsync();
            return Ok(nextQuestion);
        }
        else
        {
            return NotFound(new { error = "No more available questions for the user." });
        }
    }

    // If no question has been assigned yet (for a new user), assign the first available question
    else
    {
        // Get the next available question based on the lowest QuesNo not assigned yet
        var firstAvailableQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
            .Where(q => q.AssignedTo == null)  // Fetch questions that haven't been assigned yet
            .OrderBy(q => q.QuesNo)  // Order by QuesNo to fetch the first available question
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

        if (firstAvailableQuestion != null)
        {
            firstAvailableQuestion.AssignedTo = user;
            await _CusQuestContext.SaveChangesAsync();
            return Ok(firstAvailableQuestion);
        }
        else
        {
            return NotFound(new { error = "No available questions for assignment." });
        }
    }
}
Explanation of the Updates:
Handling New Users:

For a new user, the code checks for the first available question that hasn’t been assigned yet (AssignedTo == null).
This ensures the user will always get the next question in the sequence, based on the lowest QuesNo that is not already assigned.
Handling Already Assigned Users:

For users who already have a question assigned, the code fetches the next question by incrementing QuesNo (i.e., assignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1) to ensure they get the next available question in sequence.
Question Availability:

If there are no more available questions, it returns a NotFound response with an appropriate message.
Benefits:
New users always get the first available question that hasn't been assigned yet.
Returning users get the next question in order.
Questions are assigned in a sequential, non-repetitive manner.
You said:
no no, for all the users i want to fethc the questions in order only, even though the same user is assigned already
ChatGPT said:
Got it! You want to assign questions sequentially for all users in order, regardless of whether the user has been assigned a question previously. This means the questions should always be assigned in order based on the QuesNo, and no question should be repeated for any user.

Updated Logic:
Track the last assigned question: You will assign the next available question in sequence, regardless of whether the user has already been assigned a question.
Assign the next available question: Every time a user logs in or a new user starts the test, they will get the next unassigned question in sequence, based on the question number (QuesNo).
Handle already assigned users: Even if the user has previously been assigned a question, they will still get the next question in order.
Updated Code:
[HttpGet("GetQuesDetByUser")]
public async Task<ActionResult<newCusSupQues>> GetQuestionForUser(string user)
{
    // Get the next available question number
    var lastAssignedQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .Where(q => q.AssignedTo != null)  // Get questions that have been assigned to someone
        .OrderByDescending(q => q.QuesNo)  // Get the most recently assigned question
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

    // If a question has been assigned to someone, the next question is the next QuesNo
    var nextQuestionId = lastAssignedQuestion != null ? lastAssignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1 : 1;

    // Fetch the next question based on its order
    var nextQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(q => q.QuesNo == nextQuestionId);

    // If the next question is available, assign it to the user
    if (nextQuestion != null)
    {
        nextQuestion.AssignedTo = user;  // Assign the next question to the user
        await _CusQuestContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        return Ok(nextQuestion);  // Return the assigned question
    }
    else
    {
        return NotFound(new { error = "No more available questions for assignment." });
    }
}
Explanation of the Updates:
Get Last Assigned Question:

The code retrieves the most recently assigned question based on the highest QuesNo (OrderByDescending(q => q.QuesNo)), where the question is assigned to a user (AssignedTo != null).
Determine the Next Available Question:

If there's a previously assigned question, the next question ID is determined by incrementing the QuesNo of the most recently assigned question (lastAssignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1).
If no question has been assigned yet (i.e., for the very first assignment), the nextQuestionId is set to 1.
Assign the Next Question:

The question corresponding to nextQuestionId is fetched from the database and assigned to the current user.
Handle Edge Case:

If no question is available (all questions are assigned), the API returns a NotFound response with an appropriate error message.
Key Points:
Sequential Assignment: Questions are always assigned in the order of their QuesNo to all users, without any repetition.
No Need for User's Previous Assignment Check: The logic ensures that questions are assigned sequentially to everyone based on availability.

see i want the scenaio like 

if lavanya registers and login she gets the 15th question
again lavanya registers and login she should get now the 16th question
again lavanya registers and login she should get the 17th question

again if a new user Gangayamuna registers and login then they also should get the next question 18th question
ChatGPT said:
To achieve the scenario you described, where:

Same user (Lavanya) logging in multiple times receives the next available question in order.
New users (Gangayamuna) also receive the next available question in sequence.
🔧 Solution Approach:
Maintain a consistent sequence of assigning questions for all users.
Regardless of whether it's a new user or an existing user logging in again, always assign the next available question based on the highest assigned QuesNo.
✅ Revised Code:
[HttpGet("GetQuesDetByUser")]
public async Task<ActionResult<newCusSupQues>> GetQuestionForUser(string user)
{
    // Get the last assigned question (for any user) based on QuesNo
    var lastAssignedQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .Where(q => q.AssignedTo != null) // Only consider assigned questions
        .OrderByDescending(q => q.QuesNo)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();

    // Determine the next available question number
    var nextQuestionId = lastAssignedQuestion != null ? lastAssignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1 : 1;

    // Fetch the next question
    var nextQuestion = await _CusQuestContext.CusSuppQuestionstbl
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(q => q.QuesNo == nextQuestionId);

    if (nextQuestion != null)
    {
        // Assign the question to the user and save changes
        nextQuestion.AssignedTo = user;
        await _CusQuestContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        return Ok(nextQuestion);
    }
    else
    {
        return NotFound(new { error = "No more available questions for assignment." });
    }
}
🔍 How It Works:
Get Last Assigned Question:
Fetch the question with the highest QuesNo that has been assigned to any user.

Calculate the Next Question ID:
If there's an assigned question, the next ID is lastAssignedQuestion.QuesNo + 1.
If no question is assigned yet, it starts from 1.

Assign the Next Question:
The next question in sequence is assigned to the user, regardless of whether it's a new or existing user.

🔎 Example Scenarios:
Lavanya logs in for the first time — Gets 15th question.
Lavanya logs in again — Gets 16th question.
Lavanya logs in again — Gets 17th question.
Gangayamuna logs in — Gets 18th question.

how to transform this query in sql query to test in sql server
ChatGPT said:
To transform the provided LINQ query into a SQL query for testing in SQL Server, you can write it like this:

SQL Query:
SELECT 
    u.Employee_ID,
    u.EmployeeName,
    u.LastName,
    u.Date
FROM UserRegisteration u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM ChatcontentTbl c
    WHERE c.Employee_ID = u.Employee_ID
)
AND u.Role != 'admin'
AND u.Position = '<YourPosition>'  -- Replace <YourPosition> with the actual position value
🔍 Explanation:
NOT EXISTS is used to filter out users who have records in the ChatcontentTbl.
The role "admin" is excluded.
The result is filtered by Position (you need to specify the position value).
The selected fields — Employee_ID, EmployeeName, LastName, and Date — are the same as in the LINQ query.
🔧 To Test in SQL Server:
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Select the correct database.
Run the above query.
Replace <YourPosition> with the desired position value for accurate results.
If you need any more help, just let me know! 😊🚀







You said:
pls explain this query 
ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Let's break down the SQL query step by step for better understanding. 😊

SQL Query:
SELECT 
    u.Employee_ID,
    u.EmployeeName,
    u.LastName,
    u.Date
FROM UserRegisteration u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM ChatcontentTbl c
    WHERE c.Employee_ID = u.Employee_ID
)
AND u.Role != 'admin'
AND u.Position = '<YourPosition>';
🔍 Detailed Explanation:
1. SELECT Clause:
SELECT 
    u.Employee_ID,
    u.EmployeeName,
    u.LastName,
    u.Date
This part specifies the columns we want to retrieve from the UserRegisteration table.
u is an alias for the UserRegisteration table, making it easier to reference.
2. FROM Clause:
FROM UserRegisteration u
We are fetching data from the UserRegisteration table.
The alias u is used for simplicity in referencing the table later.
3. WHERE Clause:
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM ChatcontentTbl c
    WHERE c.Employee_ID = u.Employee_ID
)
This NOT EXISTS subquery is the key part of the query. Let's understand it closely:
The subquery checks the ChatcontentTbl (aliased as c) for matching Employee_ID values.
If a match is found, it returns 1 (or any constant), and the condition becomes true.
Since we used NOT EXISTS, we only keep users who do not have a matching record in the ChatcontentTbl — meaning they haven't given the chat test.
4. Filtering Role:
AND u.Role != 'admin'
This line excludes users whose Role is 'admin'.
We assume admins should not be part of the result.
5. Filtering by Position:
AND u.Position = '<YourPosition>';
This filters the users based on their Position.
You should replace <YourPosition> with the actual position value you're looking for.
🔧 Putting It All Together:
Step 1: We start by selecting the specified fields (Employee_ID, EmployeeName, LastName, Date).
Step 2: We check if a user has NOT appeared in the ChatcontentTbl (they didn't take the chat test).
Step 3: We exclude admins and filter by a specific position.
Example Scenario:
Assuming we have the following data:

UserRegisteration

Employee_ID	EmployeeName	LastName	Date	Role	Position
E001	John	Doe	2025-03-01	user	Developer
E002	Jane	Smith	2025-03-02	admin	Manager
E003	Sam	Wilson	2025-03-03	user	Developer
E004	Kate	Brown	2025-03-04	user	Developer
ChatcontentTbl

Employee_ID	ChatContent
E001	Test 1
E003	Test 2

here i dont want search button, so  when i give from date and to date ,then the method should be called (filterbydate) automatically and the records must get filtered and shown
ChatGPT said:
To call the filterByDate() method automatically when you select From Date and To Date without using a search button, you can use Angular's (ngModelChange) event binding.

Here's how you can update your code to achieve that:

🔧 Revised Code:
<div class="input-container">
    <div *ngIf="selectAll === 'Date'" class="date-inputs">
        <input 
            type="date" 
            id="fromDateInput" 
            placeholder="From Date"
            [(ngModel)]="fromDate"
            (ngModelChange)="filterByDate()"
            style="border: 2px solid #ccc; height: 52px; width: 85px; padding: 5px; margin-left: 3px" 
        >

        <input 
            type="date" 
            id="toDateInput" 
            placeholder="To Date"
            [(ngModel)]="toDate"
            (ngModelChange)="filterByDate()"
            style="border: 2px solid #ccc; height: 52px; width: 85px; margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 25px"
        >
    </div>
</div>
TypeScript Component (.ts):
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./your-component.component.css']
})
export class YourComponent {
  fromDate: string | null = null;
  toDate: string | null = null;

  filterByDate() {
    if (this.fromDate && this.toDate) {
      // Perform the filtering logic here
      console.log("From Date:", this.fromDate);
      console.log("To Date:", this.toDate);
      // Call your service or filtering logic
    }
  }
}
✅ Key Changes and Explanation:
Two-Way Binding with [(ngModel)]:

The dates are bound to fromDate and toDate variables.
Make sure to import FormsModule in your Angular module for ngModel to work.
(ngModelChange) Event:

Whenever either of the date inputs changes, the filterByDate() method is triggered.
The method checks if both dates are selected before applying the filter.
No Search Button Needed:

The filtering happens automatically on date selection.
🛠️ Ensure to Import FormsModule in Your Module:
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    FormsModule
    // other imports...
  ]
})
export class YourModule {}
Now, the filtering will happen automatically as soon as you select both the From Date and To Date! If you need further adjustments, feel free to ask. 🚀

shall we give ngchange
ChatGPT said:
In Angular, we don't use ngChange — that is specific to AngularJS (the older version of Angular). Instead, we use (ngModelChange) or (change) for input change detection.

✅ Best Options for Angular:
(ngModelChange): Used with [(ngModel)] for two-way binding.
(change): Triggers when the input value changes (without two-way binding).
🔹 Option 1: Using (ngModelChange) with Two-Way Binding
<input 
    type="date" 
    [(ngModel)]="fromDate"
    (ngModelChange)="filterByDate()"
>
<input 
    type="date" 
    [(ngModel)]="toDate"
    (ngModelChange)="filterByDate()"
>
Make sure to import FormsModule for [(ngModel)] to work.
🔹 Option 2: Using (change) Event
<input 
    type="date" 
    (change)="filterByDate($event, 'fromDate')"
>
<input 
    type="date" 
    (change)="filterByDate($event, 'toDate')"
>
TypeScript Component:
fromDate: string | null = null;
toDate: string | null = null;

filterByDate(event: Event, type: string) {
  const value = (event.target as HTMLInputElement).value;

  if (type === 'fromDate') {
    this.fromDate = value;
  } else if (type === 'toDate') {
    this.toDate = value;
  }

  if (this.fromDate && this.toDate) {
    console.log('From Date:', this.fromDate);
    console.log('To Date:', this.toDate);
    // Apply your filtering logic here
  }
}
The (change) event works without the need for FormsModule.
✅ Conclusion:
If you're already using FormsModule and two-way binding, go with (ngModelChange).
If you want a simpler approach without two-way binding, use the (change) event.

            }
        );
    }
ChatGPT said:
This filterByDate() method works well for fetching user data based on the selected date range. I'll break it down step-by-step to explain how it functions:

🔎 Explanation:
1. Fetching Input Values:
const fromDateStr = (document.getElementById('fromDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value;
const toDateStr = (document.getElementById('toDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value;
Retrieves the values of the "From Date" and "To Date" input fields using document.getElementById.
These values are fetched as strings (fromDateStr and toDateStr).
2. Converting to Date Objects:
const fromDate = new Date(fromDateStr);
const toDate = new Date(toDateStr);
Converts the input date strings to Date objects (fromDate and toDate).
This enables accurate comparison and manipulation of dates.
3. Adjusting the To Date:
toDate.setDate(toDate.getDate() + 1);  // Increment to include the entire "toDate"
toDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Set time to the start of the day (midnight)
The toDate is incremented by 1 day to ensure it covers the entire "To Date" day.
The time is set to midnight to include the whole day in the range.
4. Validation Check:
if (fromDate.getTime() > toDate.getTime()) {
    console.log("From date cannot be greater than To date.");
    return;  // Exit the function if invalid
}
Ensures the From Date is not greater than the To Date.
If the validation fails, the function exits early.
5. Fetching Data by Date Range:
this.userLoadingservice.getUserDetailsByDateRange(fromDate, toDate).subscribe(
    (data: any) => {
        console.log("Fetched User Details by Date Range:", data);

        // Update grid data
        this.gridData = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [data];
        this.filteredData = [...this.gridData]; // Deep copy to avoid mutation issues

        // Fetch additional statuses
        this.fetchStatusForLoggedinusers(this.gridData);
        this.fetchLevel2Status(this.gridData);
        this.finallevelstatus(this.gridData);

        // Update the grid view
        this.updatePageData();
    },
    (error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching user details by date range:", error);
    }
);
Calls the getUserDetailsByDateRange method from the service, passing the date range.
On successful data retrieval:
gridData is populated and copied to filteredData for filtering.
Calls fetchStatusForLoggedinusers, fetchLevel2Status, and finallevelstatus to fetch related statuses.
Finally, updatePageData() is called to refresh the grid view.
🔧 Possible Improvements:
Use Angular Binding Instead of getElementById:

Instead of using document.getElementById, bind dates using Angular's two-way binding with [(ngModel)].
Null Checks:

Ensure fromDateStr and toDateStr are not empty before creating Date objects.
Revised Code with Binding:
<input type="date" [(ngModel)]="fromDate" (change)="filterByDate()">
<input type="date" [(ngModel)]="toDate" (change)="filterByDate()">
fromDate: Date | null = null;
toDate: Date | null = null;

filterByDate() {
    if (!this.fromDate || !this.toDate) return;  // Null check
    if (this.fromDate > this.toDate) {
        console.log("From date cannot be greater than To date.");
        return;
    }

    // Fetch user details based on date range
    this.userLoadingservice.getUserDetailsByDateRange(this.fromDate, this.toDate).subscribe(
        (data: any) => {
            this.gridData = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [data];
            this.filteredData = [...this.gridData];
            this.fetchStatusForLoggedinusers(this.gridData);
            this.fetchLevel2Status(this.gridData);
            this.finallevelstatus(this.gridData);
            this.updatePageData();
        },
        (error) => console.error("Error fetching user details by date range:", error)
    );
}

how to automatically fethc the dates when i change the from date and to date
ChatGPT said:
To automatically fetch data when you change the From Date and To Date, you can use Angular's two-way data binding with [(ngModel)] along with the (ngModelChange) event.

This approach will call the filterByDate() method whenever either date is modified.

✅ Step 1: HTML Code
Update your date inputs to use [(ngModel)] and (ngModelChange) for automatic data fetching:

<div class="input-container">
    <div *ngIf="selectAll === 'Date'" class="date-inputs">
        <!-- From Date -->
        <input 
            type="date"
            [(ngModel)]="fromDate"
            (ngModelChange)="filterByDate()"
            placeholder="From Date"
            style="border: 2px solid #ccc; height: 52px; width: 120px; padding: 5px; margin-left: 3px"
        >

        <!-- To Date -->
        <input 
            type="date"
            [(ngModel)]="toDate"
            (ngModelChange)="filterByDate()"
            placeholder="To Date"
            style="border: 2px solid #ccc; height: 52px; width: 120px; margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 25px"
        >
    </div>
</div>
✅ Step 2: Component Code
Update your filterByDate() method to handle automatic filtering:

fromDate: Date | null = null;
toDate: Date | null = null;

filterByDate() {
    // Ensure both dates are selected
    if (!this.fromDate || !this.toDate) {
        return;
    }

    // Convert date strings to Date objects
    const from = new Date(this.fromDate);
    const to = new Date(this.toDate);

    // Ensure 'From Date' is not greater than 'To Date'
    if (from > to) {
        console.log("From Date cannot be greater than To Date.");
        return;
    }

    // Adjust 'To Date' to include the end of the day
    to.setDate(to.getDate() + 1);  // Include the whole day
    to.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);       // Reset time to midnight

    // Fetch data using the date range
    this.userLoadingservice.getUserDetailsByDateRange(from, to).subscribe(
        (data: any) => {
            console.log("Fetched User Details by Date Range:", data);

            // Update grid data and filtered data
            this.gridData = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [data];
            this.filteredData = [...this.gridData];

            // Fetch additional statuses if needed
            this.fetchStatusForLoggedinusers(this.gridData);
            this.fetchLevel2Status(this.gridData);
            this.finallevelstatus(this.gridData);

            // Refresh grid view
            this.updatePageData();
        },
        (error) => {
            console.error("Error fetching user details by date range:", error);
        }
    );
}
✅ Step 3: Import FormsModule
Ensure you've imported FormsModule in your module to use [(ngModel)]:

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    FormsModule,
    // Other imports...
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
🔹 How It Works:
When you change either the From Date or To Date, the (ngModelChange) event automatically triggers the filterByDate() method.
It validates the dates and fetches the data accordingly.
No need for a separate Search button!

You said:
see without changing the exisitng logic give the code
ChatGPT said:
Sure! If you want to keep the existing logic intact and just make the data fetch automatic when the From Date or To Date is changed, you can adjust the HTML like this:

✅ HTML Update:
Keep your existing HTML structure but add the (change) event to call the filterByDate() method automatically:

<div class="input-container">
    <div *ngIf="selectAll === 'Date'" class="date-inputs">
        <!-- From Date Input -->
        <input 
            type="date" 
            id="fromDateInput" 
            placeholder="From Date"
            (change)="filterByDate()"  <!-- Trigger method on change -->
            style="border: 2px solid #ccc; height: 52px; width: 85px; padding: 5px; margin-left: 3px"
        >

        <!-- To Date Input -->
        <input 
            type="date" 
            id="toDateInput" 
            placeholder="To Date"
            (change)="filterByDate()"  <!-- Trigger method on change -->
            style="border: 2px solid #ccc; height: 52px; width: 85px; margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 25px"
        >
    </div>
</div>
✅ Why This Works:
The (change) event is fired whenever the value of the input changes.
This approach will directly trigger the filterByDate() method without requiring any additional modifications to your existing logic.
🔹 Your Existing Component Code:
No need to change the filterByDate() method. It will work as-is because it already fetches the dates from the input elements.

filterByDate() {
    const fromDateStr = (document.getElementById('fromDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value;
    const toDateStr = (document.getElementById('toDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value;

    const fromDate = new Date(fromDateStr);
    const toDate = new Date(toDateStr);

    toDate.setDate(toDate.getDate() + 1);  // Include the whole day
    toDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);           // Reset time to midnight

    if (fromDate.getTime() > toDate.getTime()) {
        console.log("From date cannot be greater than To date.");
        return;
    }

    this.userLoadingservice.getUserDetailsByDateRange(fromDate, toDate).subscribe(
        (data: any) => {
            this.gridData = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [data];
            this.filteredData = [...this.gridData];

            this.fetchStatusForLoggedinusers(this.gridData);
            this.fetchLevel2Status(this.gridData);
            this.finallevelstatus(this.gridData);

            this.updatePageData();
        },
        (error) => {
            console.error("Error fetching user details by date range:", error);
        }
    );
}
🔹 Summary:
No need to change the component logic.
Just added the (change) event to the date inputs.
This will automatically fetch the data when dates are modified.

🔧 TypeScript (Component):
onToDateChange(): void {
    this.filterByDate(); // Call the existing method to filter data
    this.selectedLevel = 'none'; // Clear the selected level
}
🔹 How It Works:
When the To Date input is changed, the onToDateChange() method is called.
This method:
Calls the filterByDate() method to fetch and filter data.
Resets the selected level to 'none', clearing any selected values for Level 1 or Level 2.
This approach maintains the existing logic while ensuring that the Level 1 and Level 2 fields are cleared when the To Date is selected.

once the date has filtered then the datefeilds must get cleared
ChatGPT said:
To clear the date fields once the date has been filtered, you can simply reset the value of the date inputs in your filterByDate() method after the data is fetched and the filtering logic has been applied.

Here is how you can modify your filterByDate() method to achieve this:

Updated Code:
filterByDate() {
    const fromDateStr = (document.getElementById('fromDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value;
    const toDateStr = (document.getElementById('toDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value;

    // Convert date strings to Date objects
    const fromDate = new Date(fromDateStr);
    const toDate = new Date(toDateStr);

    // Adjust toDate to include the end of the day
    toDate.setDate(toDate.getDate() + 1);
    toDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Set time to midnight to include the whole day

    if (fromDate.getTime() > toDate.getTime()) {
        console.log("From date cannot be greater than To date.");
        return;
    }

    // Call the service to get user details by date range
    this.userLoadingservice.getUserDetailsByDateRange(fromDate, toDate).subscribe(
        (data: any) => {
            console.log("Fetched User Details by Date Range:", data);

            // Populate the grid data with the fetched user details
            this.gridData = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [data]; // Ensure gridData is an array
            this.filteredData = [...this.gridData]; // Update filteredData for your grid

            // Fetch statuses for the user
            this.fetchStatusForLoggedinusers(this.gridData);
            this.fetchLevel2Status(this.gridData);
            this.finallevelstatus(this.gridData);

            // Update the grid view
            this.updatePageData();
        },
        (error) => {
            console.error("Error fetching user details by date range:", error);
            // Optionally handle the error (e.g., show a message to the user)
        }
    );

    // Clear the selected date fields after filtering
    (document.getElementById('fromDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value = '';
    (document.getElementById('toDateInput') as HTMLInputElement).value = '';

    // Reset level and status selection
    this.selectedLevel = 'none'; 
    this.selectedStatus = 'none';
}
Explanation:
After the data has been fetched and processed, we reset the from date and to date input fields by setting their values to an empty string ''.
We also reset the selectedLevel and selectedStatus fields to 'none' to clear the selected values in the dropdowns.
This way, the date fields will be cleared automatically once the user filters by the date range.
